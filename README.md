# Untold

> Every untold story deserves a voice.

**Untold** is a privacy-first, fully anonymous sharing hub where stories matter more than identities. It provides a safe, distraction-free space for sharing funny moments, developer jokes, confessions, silent victories, and life lessons without exposing your personal identity.

---

## ✦ Brand Philosophy

Most social platforms ask: **"Who are you?"**  
Untold asks: **"What's your story?"**

We believe that sharing real experiences without the pressure of a personal brand, profile picture, or follower count leads to deeper empathy and cleaner connections.

## ✦ Core Features

- **Profile-Free Anonymity:** No user registration, passwords, or handles. Your voice is defined by a local unique author signature.
- **Dynamic Tag Filter & Tag Search:** Select from presets or type to create custom tags. Filter the story feed instantly using a searchable tags index.
- **Upvote Reactions:** Empathy over clicks. Support stories with a simple, helpful upvote button.
- **Anonymous Comments:** Participate in threads with automatically generated, comforting anonymous names (e.g., *Kind Panda*, *Wise Cloud*).
- **Subscribe to Voices (Aura Follows):** Follow specific anonymous authors by subscribing to their voice's unique color gradient aura, which populates your custom "Following Voices" feed.
- **Privacy-Preserving Recovery Bindings:** Secure your anonymous signature using an email or phone number. Details are processed server-side using SHA-256 hashes so that no plain text ever touches the database, allowing you to recover your writer profile if you switch devices or clear browser caches.
- **Neon Database Integration:** High-performance persistence layer using serverless PostgreSQL. The application auto-seeds standard mock data if initialized on a fresh database, and automatically falls back to full-featured client-side mocks and `localStorage` if database connection strings are absent.

## ✦ Technical Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (incorporating glassmorphism, responsive grids, sleek dark mode transitions, and dynamic mesh glow animations)
- **Database:** Serverless PostgreSQL via `@neondatabase/serverless`
- **Security:** Node's native `crypto` module for server-side contact hashing (SHA-256)
